//*****************************************************************************
// Virtual memory: consists of memory pages and a main memory with limited capacity
// Page: represented by an integer; main memory can hold up to K pages
// Page replacement: when the main memory reaches its limit (i.e., having K pages) 
// and a new page (not currently in memory) is to be add, 
// then need to swap out one current page to make room for this new page
// This class: use OPT or LRU algorithm




//  idea behind the code    //


//idea is to use a set to get those fast look ups
//vector to easily move things around 
//get the best of both fast look ups and actually be able to move things around for later use 

//so imagining a list we just check to see if a certain id is in it
//if it is not then page fault

//idea for LRU is using a vector to move any pages that are used to the front
//after we reach the capacity lets say 10 pages remove the one at the end 
//and add the new one to the front
